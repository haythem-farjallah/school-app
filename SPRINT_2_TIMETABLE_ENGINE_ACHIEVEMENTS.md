   - ✅ Teachers CRUD endpoints
   - ✅ Courses CRUD endpoints  
   - ✅ Rooms CRUD endpoints
   - ✅ Timetable optimization endpoints
   - ✅ Authentication endpoints

2. **Unit Tests**: Backend testing framework
   - ✅ `TimetableServiceOptimizationTest.java` - Optimization testing
   - ✅ API endpoint testing structure
   - ✅ Service layer testing

3. **Testing Documentation**: 
   - ✅ `TIMETABLE_OPTIMIZATION_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
   - ✅ `test_timetable_optimization.md` - Auto-generate testing instructions

### **❌ Missing Testing Components**
1. **Frontend Unit Tests**: No Jest/React Testing Library tests found
2. **E2E Tests**: No Cypress tests for timetable workflows
3. **API Integration Tests**: Limited integration test coverage
4. **Performance Tests**: No load testing for optimization algorithms

## ⚠️ **Outstanding Issues & TODOs**

### **🔧 Current System Limitations**

#### **1. Timetable Interface Issues**
- **Problem**: Main `/admin/timetable` route shows empty/non-functional interface
- **Working Interface**: `/admin/smart-timetable` has full functionality
- **Status**: ❌ **NEEDS FIXING** - Need to redirect or fix main timetable page

#### **2. Missing Functionality from Backlog**
- ❌ **Teacher Availability Windows**: UI for teachers to set availability preferences
- ❌ **Suggested Slots Endpoint**: API for suggesting optimal time slots
- ❌ **Manual Slot Suggestions**: Interface for getting placement suggestions

#### **3. Missing Edit/Add Functionality**
- ❌ **Room Assignment in Timetable**: Manual room editing in timetable grid
- ❌ **Teacher Assignment Editor**: Manual teacher assignment interface
- ❌ **Course Assignment Editor**: Manual course assignment interface

### **📋 TODO List for Next Sprint**
