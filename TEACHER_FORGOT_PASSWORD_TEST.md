## 🏗️ **How It Works Technically**

### Backend Implementation
The `CustomUserDetailsService.findBaseUserByEmail()` method searches across **all user repositories**:

```java
return Stream.of(
    studentRepo.findByEmail(email),
    teacherRepo.findByEmail(email),    // ← Teachers included!
    parentRepo.findByEmail(email),
    adminRepo.findByEmail(email),
    staffRepo.findByEmail(email)
)
```

### User Type Detection
- The system automatically detects the user type based on which repository contains the email
- All user types inherit from `BaseUser` which contains the OTP fields
- No special handling needed for different user types

### Email Template
- The OTP email template uses the user's `firstName` field
- Works for all user types since they all have this field from `BaseUser`
